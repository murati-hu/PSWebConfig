PSWebConfig is a PowerShell module that provides an easy way to automatically decrypt,
inspect and test web.config or any .NET based application configuration files both
locally or remotely.

## Installation
PSWebConfig is available via [PowerShell Gallery][PowerShellGallery] or [PsGet][psget],
so you can simply install it with the following command:
```powershell
Install-Module PSWebConfig

# Or alternatevely you can install it with PsGet from this repository
Install-Module -ModuleUrl https://github.com/murati-hu/PSWebConfig/archive/master.zip
```
Of course you can download and install the module manually too from
[Downloads][download]

## Usage
```powershell
Import-Module PSWebConfig
```

## Examples
### View and decrypt a web.config
`Get-PSWebConfig` cmdlet automatically fetches and decrypts any web.config
file both locally and remotely without altering the actual config file on the
target computer:
```powershell
# Pipe any site into Get-PSWebConfig to show the decrypted config
Get-Website | Get-PSWebConfig -AsText

# You can use -Path attribute to find web.config files
Get-PSWebConfig -Path C:\inetpub\wwwroot\

# If you wish to override the config with its decrypted version
Get-Website | Decrypt-PSWebConfig -Confirm $false
```
### Test config files
`Test-PSWebConfig` function  allows complete tests on all connectionStrings and
Service addresses from a configuration both on local or remote computers.
```powershell
# Pipe a config into Test-PSWebConfig
Get-Website * | Test-PSWebConfig

# Or use -Session to test it via remote PSSession
$server1 = New-PSSession 'server1.local.domain'
Get-PSWebConfig -Path C:\inetpub\wwwroot\ -Session $server1 | Test-PSWebConfig
```

### Inspect ConnectionStrings
```powershell
# Pipe Get-PSWebConfig into Get-PSConnectionString to get decrypted connectionstrings
Get-Website * | Get-PSWebConfig | Get-PSConnectionString

# You can also use -IncludeAppSettings to find connectionstrings from appSetting section
Get-PSWebConfig -Path C:\inetpub\wwwroot\ | Get-PSConnectionString -IncludeAppSettings
```

### Test ConnectionStrings
`Test-PSConnectionString` cmdlet tries to initiate a SQL connection from a local or
remote computer to test if there are any issue connection to a database.
```powershell
# Pipe Get-PSConnectionString to Test-PSConnectionString
Get-Website * | Get-PSWebConfig | Get-PSConnectionString -Inc | Test-PSConnectionString

# You can also transform the connectionString with regex -ReplaceRules hashtable
Test-PSConnectionString -Conn "Server=dbserver.local;Database=##TARGET_DB##" -ReplaceRules @{ '##TARGET_DB##'='myDb'}
```

### Inspect appSettings
```powershell
# Pipe Get-PSWebConfig into Get-PSAppSetting to get decrypted appSettings
Get-Website * | Get-PSWebConfig | Get-PSAppSetting
```

### Get service endpoints and URIs
```powershell
# Pipe Get-PSWebConfig into Get-PSEndpoint to get decrypted webservice addresses
Get-Website * | Get-PSWebConfig | Get-PSEndpoint

# Or pipe Get-PSWebConfig into Get-PSUri to get URLs from appSettings too.
Get-Website * | Get-PSWebConfig | Get-PSUri
```
